# Plant-disease-detection-and-classification-using-CNN-Deep_Learning
This is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning model designed for the detection and classification of plant diseases from images. The model helps in identifying whether a plant is diseased or healthy, and if diseased, classifies the specific type of disease affecting the plant.
